Fibonacci File

Fibonacci.h, Fibonacci.cpp, main.cpp, Makefile, README.txt are all of the documents for the fib file.

This program takes the method choice and the input value from the user, then determines whether to implement the recursion function or the iterative function based off of the users choice to determine the fibonacci number at index n.

I utilized the Sublime text editor and the Ubunta Commandline in order to compile this program by methods of creating a Makefile.  In order to compile this program correctly, then all of the files have to be copied into their own directory which I called mine "Lab3".  After this is done, then you have to make the "fib" file by typing <make> into the commandline.  Then by looking at the "lab3" directory, you should have "fib" file which usually appears as a bright yellow directory.  In order to run this you must type  </.fib> and then <enter>.  In order to clean the file or to re-make the file, then you must type <make clean> in the same lab3 directory. This should clean the file for a new rebuild.  

Enclosed in "double-quotation marks" indicates a file or directory name.
Enclosed in <arrow operators tag structure> indicates buttons needed to be pressed by programmer or end-user.

Test data for the Input Values are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10.
Test data for the User Choice Input are: h, H, i, I, j, J, q, Q, r, R, s, S.
